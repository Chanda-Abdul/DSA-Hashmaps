## 4. Remove duplicates

Implement a function to delete all duplicated characters in a string and keep only the first occurrence of each character. For example, if the input is string `“google”`, the result after deletion is `“gole”`. Test your program with a sentence as well such as `"google all that you think can think of"`.

```
function duplicate(strng) {
  strng = strng.toLowerCase()
  let dupe = new HashMap()
  let newStrng = '';
 for (let i = 0; i < strng.length; i++) {
   let char = strng[i]
   if (!dupe.hasOwnProperty(char)) {
      dupe.set(char, '')
     newStrng += char
      }
 }
  return newStrng
}
console.log(duplicate('google all that you think can think of'))
```
