## 4. Remove duplicates

Implement a function to delete all duplicated characters in a string and keep only the first occurrence of each character. For example, if the input is string `“google”`, the result after deletion is `“gole”`. Test your program with a sentence as well such as `"google all that you think can think of"`.

```
function duplicate(str) {
     let dupe = new HashMap();
     for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
       dupe.set(str[i], str[i])
     }  
     console.log(dupe)
     let newStr = '';
     dupe._hashTable.forEach(letter => {
       newStr += letter.value;
     })
     console.log(newStr)
   }

console.log(duplicate('google all that you think can think of'))
```
