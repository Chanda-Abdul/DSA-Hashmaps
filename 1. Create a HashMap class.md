# 1. Create a HashMap class

Walk through the ```HashMap``` implementation in the curriculum and understand it well. Then write a ```HashMap``` class and its core functions with open addressing as the collision resolution mechanism.

Export your ```HashMap``` module
- Create a ```.js``` file called ```HashMaps_drills```. 
- In the file import the ```HashMap``` module. Create a function called ```main()```
- Inside your ```main()``` function, create a hash map called ```lotr```.
- For your hash map that you have created, set the MAX_LOAD_RATIO = 0.5 and SIZE_RATIO = 3.
- Add the following items to your hash map: ```{"Hobbit": "Bilbo"}, {"Hobbit": "Frodo"}, {"Wizard": "Gandalf"}, {"Human": "Aragorn"}, {"Elf": "Legolas"}, {"Maiar": "The Necromancer"}, {"Maiar": "Sauron"}, {"RingBearer": "Gollum"}, {"LadyOfLight": "Galadriel"}, {"HalfElven": "Arwen"}, {"Ent": "Treebeard"}```
- Print your hash map and notice the length and items that are hashed in your hash map. Have you hashed all the items you were asked to?
- Retrieve the value that is hashed in the key ```"Maiar"``` and ```Hobbit```.
- What are the values of ```Maiar``` and ```Hobbit``` that you have? Is there a discrepancy? Explain your answer.
- What is the capacity of your hash table after you have hashed all the above items? Explain your answer.

const Hashmap = require(./HashMap)


function main() {
  const lotr = new HashMap() 
  lotr.MAX_LOAD_RATIO = 0.5;
  lotr.SIZE_RATIO = 3;
  
  lotr.set("Hobbit", "Bilbo") 
  lotr.set("Hobbit", "Frodo")
  lotr.set("Wizard", "Gandolf") 
  lotr.set("Human", "Aragorn")
  lotr.set("Elf", "Legolas")
  lotr.set("Maiar", "The Necromancer") 
  lotr.set("Maiar", "Sauron")
  lotr.set("RingBearer", "Gollum")
  lotr.set("LadyOfLight", "Galadriel")
  lotr.set("HalfElven", "Arwen")
  lotr.set("Ent", "Treebeard")
  
  console.log(lotr.length);
  console.log(lotr.get('Hobbit'))
  console.log(lor.get('Maiar'))
  console.log(lor);
  console.log(lor._capacity);
